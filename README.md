# PersonalResume
Personal resume for stormsntides.

## Overview

Website designed to showcase my resume to potential employers. This website will have links to codepen and glitch projects as well as host personal demos. Everything will be hosted on Heroku.

Routing structure is as follows:

- __Home__: `[base-url]/`
- __Projects__: `[base-url]/projects`

## Endpoints

### Home

Provides a brief description of me and my skills. It also provides links to the other pages and contains a navbar for easy navigation to the other pages.

### Projects

Provides a collection of projects and demos that can be clicked on and viewed on the website or codepen/glitch.

## Goal

I want to provide an easily accessible place for my resume to be hosted and viewed by potential employers. By hosting it on the web, no downloads will be required and information can be easily linked to. The website can also be updated quickly and effeciently since each page is its own container of information.

## Notes

A license file was intentionally not included in this work. Since this is my personal resume page, I do not think it is appropriate to have it be forked or contributed to by other users. I hope that this is an understandable position I am taking and that my wishes will be respected. I sincerely appreciate your understanding.
